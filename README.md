## Poem
In the quiet hours, 'neath the moon's soft glow,
Two feline souls once danced in tender bond.
Lunar, with fur like starlight's gentle flow,
And Moana, whose fold'd ears, a magic wand.

In warmth they nestled, side by side they played,
Their purrs a melody of harmony.
But time, a subtle force, their bond decayed,
Their once-shared love eclipsed by enmity.

Now Lunar roams alone, her spirit wanes,
Moana ponders in his solitude.
Yet hope, a beacon in their hearts remains,
A flicker in the night, a quiet feud.

Oh, may their paths converge once more, I pray,
In love's embrace, beneath the sun's warm ray.
Together, in our home, they'll find their way,
In joy and peace, united, come what may.
